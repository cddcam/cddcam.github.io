I'm a second year PhD student in the Machine Learning Group at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Rich Turner](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/people/richard-turner/) and advised by [José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/people/jose-miguel-hernandez-lobato/). My research interests lie in probabilistic machine learning for spatio-temporal data, with a focus on diffusion and flow models for partial differential equations (PDEs) and weather modelling. I am also interested in scaling up neural processes to large datasets.

Before my PhD, I worked for a couple of years at a health-tech company based in Cambridge called [L2S2](https://l2s2.com/). There, I worked on developing machine learning algorithms for early disease detection, and on the data development of the national Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS) Max. Prior to that, I completed an M.Eng. at University of Cambridge, where I worked with [Anurag Agarwal](https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/aa406) on blood pressure estimation using machine learning techniques.
